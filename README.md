1. Given an integer array nums, return the number of elements that have both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums. 

Example 1: 

Input: nums = [11,7,2,15] 

Output: 2 

Explanation: The element 7 has the element 2 strictly smaller than it and the element 11 strictly greater than it. 

Element 11 has element 7 strictly smaller than it and element 15 strictly greater than it. 

In total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums. 

Example 2: 

Input: nums = [-3,3,3,90] 

Output: 2 

Explanation: Element 3 has the element -3 strictly smaller than it and the element 90 strictly greater than it. 

Since there are two elements with the value 3, in total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums. 

2. The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes: 

41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 

This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred. 

The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953. 

Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?
